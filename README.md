# NHANES Analysis

### Since 1974, the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) has gathered yearly data on adults and childrens in the United States for nutritional intake, weight, blood pressure, and other health factors. 

### The data, published in 2-year cycles, are gathered through interviews, physical examinations, and lab tests.

### Given its representative nature through techniques like overrepresentation of some groups, NHANES is a good source of data to test concerns that factors such as weight or blood pressure are worsening in the American population.

### Such an analysis could also serve to confirm or challenge frightening headlines, many of whom rely on NHANES data, like the following:
